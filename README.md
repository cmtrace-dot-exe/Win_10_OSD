# Win_10_OSD
A Collection of ConfigMgr/SCCM OSD Deployment Resources

This repository contains PowerShell scripts, batch files and task sequences for use in the deployment of Windows 10 in both wipe & load and in-place upgrade scenarios.

Suggestions, contributions and corrections to my sloppy code are always welcome and appreciated.
